This project focuses on building a machine learning–based credit card default prediction system to identify whether a customer is likely to default on their credit card payment. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques—from data preprocessing to model evaluation—on a real-world, imbalanced financial dataset.

The project demonstrates practical knowledge of:

1)Data preprocessing and feature handling

2)Class imbalance management

3)Model training and comparison

4)Performance evaluation using multiple metrics

Models Trained:-

1)SVM

2)Logistic regression

3)Decision trees

4)Random Forests

5)XGboosting decision Trees

6)Gradient boosting Trees

7)PCA for visualization

8)GMM

9)K-means clustering to visualize the clusters and get insights
